# Minesweeper Game

A simple implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the frontend), and PHP (for the backend game logic). The game features a 10x10 grid where players need to reveal cells without hitting any mines.

## Features
- **Grid-based gameplay:** Reveal cells to find mines.
- **Backend logic in PHP:** Mines are randomly placed and neighboring cells are calculated server-side.
- **AJAX integration:** Smooth game interactions between the frontend and backend.
- **Basic CSS styling:** A clean and simple layout for the game.
